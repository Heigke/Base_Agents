# Base_Agents
In this project we aim to create decentralized base functions for a future digital society.
Base functions consists of several lightweight agent processes which with eg a distributed ledger give
functionality such as a "distributed trust network", "beacon function to be found by others", "torch function to find others beacon signals" etc.
With [ColonyOS](https://colonyos.io/) we hope to be able to distribute tasks which will be linked with the trust function to create trust in entities which
show altruistic behaviour.
